# CI Pipeline — Gate Audit

> What must pass before code reaches `main`, `staging`, and `production`, in order;

## Gate-by-gate

All CI jobs run on `pull_request` (any target branch) and on `push` to `main`.
Every job checks out with `persist-credentials: false` and uses the shared
`.github/actions/setup` (pnpm + Node from `.nvmrc` + Turbo remote cache).
Third-party actions are SHA-pinned.

Local equivalents before pushing: `pnpm format`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`,
`pnpm build`, `pnpm test` (see [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md#build-test-and-development-commands)).

## Deploy pipeline (per app)

Merges to `main` don't deploy anything directly. `release-please.yml` maintains
per-app release PRs; merging one pushes a tag like `map@1.2.3`, which triggers
that app's thin `deploy-<app>.yml` caller into the shared
[`_deploy-cloudrun.yml`](../.github/workflows/_deploy-cloudrun.yml):

1. **`ci-gate`** — waits (does not re-run) for
   `build|lint|typecheck|format-check|test-coverage` to succeed on the tagged
   SHA.
2. **`build`** — the deploy image is built once and pushed to Artifact
   Registry.
3. **`deploy-staging`** — Cloud Run in the staging project; optional
   post-deploy cache revalidation.
4. **`deploy-prod`** — requires staging success, then Cloud Run in the prod
   project.

## Observations

- `docker-build` runs on every PR but is **not** in the `main` ruleset's
  required checks — an image-only breakage can merge and will surface at
  release time in the deploy `build` job.
- The deploy `ci-gate` regexp waits on the five build/test checks but not
  `security-audit` (the audit already gated the merge; a tag cut from an
  unmerged or old SHA relies on that earlier gate).
- The two reserved rungs below are the planned homes for end-to-end
  verification, which today has no rung at all.

## Reserved rungs (planned, not yet implemented)

These do not exist yet and are documented for future reference:

- **`preview-env`** — per-PR Cloud Run preview environment, opt-in via a
  `preview` label; scale-to-zero; own seeded database; torn down on PR
  close/merge plus a daily TTL reaper. Slots in as a PR job alongside the
  existing gates.
- **`e2e-blocking`** — a deliberately small Playwright suite (the
  critical-path cases from each feature spec in [`specs/`](../specs/), plus an
  RBAC matrix) running against the preview environment, with traces/video on
  failure. Blocking: red means no merge. Everything beyond the critical paths
  runs as a separate **advisory** E2E tier that never blocks.
